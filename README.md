This repo will serve as a backup for this project implementation and possible future use - Year 3 Sem 1

## How To Use
Download the following and make sure they are kept in the same directory
- ConstellationDataset folder
- PyTorch_AugmentingData.ipynb
- Template_Matching.py

To augment the data open the Jupyter notebook and run each block. Variables can be modified as needed, for example. One can change the number of augmented images created by changing the `num_of_iterations_per_image` variable. By default, it is set to 50.

Then, run the python script from your preferred IDE or the terminal.
To accomplish this, open the folder in the terminal and run this command.

`On Windows Use`
```
python Template_Matching.py
```
`On Max or Linux Use`
```
python3 Template_Matching.py
```
